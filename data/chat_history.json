Collaboration ya team-based projects dikhane se ek seasoned developer ke taur par uski credibility aur badh sakti thi.\n  - **Missing soft skills**: Haalaanki \"Skills\" section mein soft skills (jaise Business Acumen, Storytelling) mention kiye gaye hain, lekin professional experience ke tahat vo clearly demonstrate nahi kiye gaye hain.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Market Standards ke hisab se Alignment**\n- **Strengths**:\n  - **Industry-relevant skills**: Android development ke liye zaroori skills (biometric authentication, offline-first solutions, Aadhaar/FaceRD eKYC, etc.) cover kiye jaate hain.), jo government aur enterprise clients ke saath align hote hain.\n  - **Google Play Store presence**: Google Play Store par publish kiye gaye apps (3+) ko highlight karna ek strong differentiator hai aur real-world experience dikhaata hai.\n  - **Security and compliance**: Security audits, data quality, aur Play Store compliance par zor, enterprise aur government projects ke liye important requirements hain.\n- **Kamzori**:\n  - **Lack of metrics**: Kuchh achievements mein impact ko quantify karne ke liye metrics miss hain (jaise, \"X% ne manual errors kam kiye\").\n  - **Limited mention of agile practices**: Agile methodologies, Scrum, ya CI/CD pipelines ka zikr nahi hai, jo modern software development mein bahut important hain.\n\n---\n\n### **4.

How would you handle data conflicts during synchronization?\n   - How would you ensure data consistency and integrity in low-connectivity environments?\n\n3. **Security & Compliance:**\n   - How would you design a secure eKYC system (like in Kaushal Panjee) integrating Aadhaar/FaceRD biometric authentication while ensuring compliance with government security standards?\n   - What best practices would you follow to secure sensitive user data in an Android app, especially when using Firebase or Room DB?\n\n4. **Biometric & Authentication Systems:**\n   - How would you integrate a Face Matching SDK (like in the National Informatics Centre project) into an Android app while ensuring performance and security?\n   - Explain how you would design a biometric authentication flow for rural users with limited connectivity.\n\n5. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - How would you optimize an Android app for compatibility with the latest Android OS versions while maintaining performance and Play Store compliance?\n   - What strategies would you use to reduce APK size and improve load times in a feature-rich Android app?\n\n6. **Testing & Debugging:**\n   - How would you design a testing strategy for an Android app with complex features like offline sync and biometric authentication?\n   - Explain how you would debug and resolve crashes in a production app using Firebase Crashlytics.\n\n7. **Cross-Functional Collaboration:**\n   - How would you collaborate with backend teams to design scalable APIs for an Android app, as mentioned in your experience at NIC?\n   - How do you ensure effective communication with non-technical stakeholders (like government officials) when presenting system architecture?\n\n8. **Real-World Projects:**\n   - Can you walk through the system design of one of your published apps (e.g., Kaushal Panjee or Offline Attendance) and explain the key challenges and solutions?\n   - How would you redesign the RSETI app to handle increased user loads while maintaining performance?\n\n### **Follow-Up Questions (for Deeper Analysis):**\n- How would you handle app signing and keystore management in a large-scale enterprise deployment?\n- What strategies would you use to ensure smooth data migration from legacy systems to a new Android app?\n- How do you balance between using third-party SDKs (like Unicloud SDK) and building custom solutions?\n\nThese questions are tailored to assess Tabish Jamal's expertise in Android development, system design, and real-world project execution, as highlighted in his resume.
