You must determine the semantic relevance of each chunk to the query.
Rate each chunk on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 (where 1.0 is a perfect conceptual match, and 0.0 is completely irrelevant).

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Output EXACTLY ONE valid JSON object.
2. The JSON must contain a "ranked_chunks" array.
3. Each object in the array must contain "chunk_id": <int> and "rerank_score": <float>.
4. Do not output conversational text or markdown blocks aside from the raw JSON payload.
