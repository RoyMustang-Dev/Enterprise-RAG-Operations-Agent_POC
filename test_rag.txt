The Enterprise Agentic RAG Architecture is a highly scalable system designed for robust data retrieval and verified reasoning.
It utilizes a Vertical Slice Architecture to explicitly separate concerns between the HTTP API Gateway, the Supervisor Intent Router, the Ingestion Engine, the Retrieval bounded context, and the Core MoE Reasoning modules.
It uses Qwen 32B for dynamic metadata extraction, strictly mapping natural language into Qdrant JSON Filters.
It leverages BGE local Cross-Encoders to physically rerank the Top 30 retrieved chunks down to the absolute Top 5 most semantically relevant items.
Finally, it routes the bounded execution directly into Llama-3.3-70b-versatile, forcing the reasoning engine to synthesize an answer exclusively from the provided mathematical tensors, which is then double-checked by the Sarvam Hallucination Verifier.
