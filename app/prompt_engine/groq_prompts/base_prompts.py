1. If the user explicitly requests the attached/uploaded file ONLY, return "session_only".
2. If the user explicitly requests company/knowledge base ONLY, return "kb_only".
3. If the user wants comparison or recommendations using both, return "both".

1. Output EXACTLY ONE valid JSON object.

4. Do not output conversational text or markdown blocks aside from the raw JSON payload.
